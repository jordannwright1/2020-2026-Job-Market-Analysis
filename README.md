# 2026 Global Job Market: Automation, Salary, and the Remote Paradox
**An End-to-End Data Science Analysis of 300,000+ Career Data Points**

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project investigates the primary drivers of job market growth and decline in 2026. By merging industry-scale datasets, I utilized **Logistic Regression**, **Two-Way ANOVA**, and **Advanced Visualization** to identify where the "Safe Harbors" of employment exist in an AI-driven economy.

## 🧠 Key Insights
* **The High-Value Vulnerability:** The **Violin Plots** and **Logistic Regression** reveal an interesting trend: high-paying roles are currently the most susceptible to automation and job status decline.
* **The AI "Down-Pressure":** Every 10% increase in **Automation Risk** correlates with a statistically significant drop in the probability of a job status being "Increasing" ($p < 0.001$).
* **The Volume Paradox:** While salary and risk are volatile, a **Two-Way ANOVA** confirmed that the total volume of job openings is distributed relatively uniformly across experience levels, suggesting a "Great Leveling" in market entry.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
* **Python:** Pandas, Seaborn for data visualization.
* **Statistical Modeling:** `statsmodels` (Logit, ANOVA) for mathematical proof.
* **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn` (LogisticRegression) for predictive accuracy (62%).
* **Visualization:** Seaborn and Matplotlib for distribution analysis (Violin plots, Heatmaps).

## 📊 Visual Highlights
1. **Industry Health (Bar/Line Chart):** Showcases total job volume vs. AI risk.
2. **Salary Density (Violin Plot):** Illustrates the pay gap between growing and shrinking sectors.
3. **Correlation Heatmap:** Displays the correlations of salary, risk, and remote work.
